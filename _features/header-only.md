ArduinoJson is a [header-only library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header-only), meaning that all the code is the headers.

This greatly simplifies the compilation as you don't have to worry about compiling and linking the library.

A single file distribution is also available; that way, you just need to download one header.
