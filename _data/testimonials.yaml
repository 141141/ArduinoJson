    I tried <b>aJson</b> and <b>json-arduino</b> before trying your library. I always ran into memory problem after a while.
    I have no such problem so far with your library. It is working perfectly with my web services.
    Thanks Benoit for a very well polished product!

    It has a really elegant, simple API and it works like a charm on embedded and Windows/Linux platforms.
    We recently started using this on an embedded project and I can vouch for its quality.

    I've been watching you consistently develop this library over the past six months, and I used it today for a publish and subscribe architecture designed to help hobbyists move into more advanced robotics.
    Your library allowed me to implement remote subscription in order to facilitate multi-processor robots.

    This is a great library and I wouldn't be able to do the project I'm doing without it. I completely recommend it.

    I am just starting an ESP8266 clock project and now I can output JSON from my server script and interpret it painlessly.

    ArduinoJson library should be used as a benchmark/reference for making libraries. Truly elegant.
